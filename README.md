### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the
magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks

1. Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve
geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.
2. Add the data to a map

### Approach

- Use base JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and
magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
- Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API
request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
